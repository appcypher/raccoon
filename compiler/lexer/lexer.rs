/// ### NOTE
/// May turn [lex] function into an iterator in the future to support generating tokens on demand.
///
/// As notedÂ¹ by some, certain lexer errors may be caused by invalid syntax, but the lexer error
/// shows first because it comes before the parser.
///
/// In addition to lex function becoming a generator, may also change Parser.code to an generator to be gotten on demand.
///
/// This has the benefit of not keeping everything in memory in case lexer / parser fails early
